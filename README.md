BLZip/BLUnZip
=============

A simple C++ wrapper for zlib + minizip

This isn't meant to provide comprehensive support for zip files, 
but something simple to, for example, extract content from a zip file 
for game data, to be directly loaded in to a RAM buffer or std::string.

It should also support password protected zip content as well.

There is preliminary support for Zip/compressing files too, although it
is untested.
